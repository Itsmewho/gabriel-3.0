Code in this file is all the code you will need to run the scrapper for the economic_events. (forex factory.)

- Keep in mind: mt5-application is using GMT+ 3 at the momement if you live in a timezone with DST this can be tricky to sync the data.
- Check event times from mt5 application.
- I may update this but still have to look into the mq5l language to get the data from there ( so time conversion wont be a issue anymore)
